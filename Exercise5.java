        Write a program that:
            - takes a word from the user through the console
            - decides which data type the input resembles
            - will print the respective data type and the corresponding input in the following format:
                 "Your input <input> is suggested to be a <data type>"
            - asks the user to decide whether the suggested data type is correct; confirm is so, deny if not
            - if the suggested data type is correct:
                calls a separate method that will return the input in its respective suggested data type
            - if the suggested data type is incorrect:
                tests whether the input can be converted into the data type the user suggests or not
                - if so: calls a separate method that will return the input in the respective data type the user suggested
                - if not: tells the user that the data types cannot be converted (easily)
