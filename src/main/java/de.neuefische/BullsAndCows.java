 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BULLS AND COWS (aka Mastermind)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The user must guess a 4-digit secret code.
 * If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".
 *
 * Example:
 *      secret code: 4271
 *      users guess: 1234
 *      Result: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1")
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Tasks:
 *      [ ] set a secret code
 *      [ ] let the user enter a guess
 *      [ ] compare the guess with the secret code (rules see above)
 *      [ ] output the result in the format "%d bull(s) and %d cow(s)."
 *      [ ] if the user guessed the secret code correct:
 *          - output "You found the secret code. Congratulations!"
 *          - the game then stops
 *      [ ] if the user does not guess the secret code:
 *          - ask for the next guess
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Bonus:
 *      [ ] randomly generate the secret code (consists of 4 digits from 0-9, the digits must be all different)
 *      [ ] implement a maximum number of turns the user has to guess the secret code
 *      [ ] validate the user input (the rules are the same as for the secret code generation)
